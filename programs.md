<h3>Scolarship requirements</h3>

<h1> EMPA - Materials Science and Technolgy </h1>

	<p>
	    Here is a <a href = "https://www.empa.ch/web/empa/"> 
	    link </a> to a web-site of the group
	</p>
	<p>
	    They are based on ETH Zurich university and develop primarilly solar-cells. They
	    are mixture of engineering and fundamrntal science and sth like, I suppose,
	    a Nanomaterials lab in Skoltech
	</p>
	<p>
	    They even have <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/user/EmpaChannel/videos">
	    YouTube channel </a> and it is wonderful at some sence :))
