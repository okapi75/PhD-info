<h3>Scolarship requirements</h3>
<h6>Interesting! The process is highly competitive. Normally, strong 
applicants who have been made PhD offers between November 
and February have higher chances of securing funding.

	    Here is a <a href = "https://www.empa.ch/web/empa/"> 
	    link </a> to a web-site of the group
	</p>
	<p>
	    They are based on ETH Zurich university and develop primarilly solar-cells. They
	    are mixture of engineering and fundamrntal science and sth like, I suppose,
	    a Nanomaterials lab in Skoltech
	</p>
	<p>
	    They even have <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/user/EmpaChannel/videos">
	    YouTube channel </a> and it is wonderful at some sence :))

  some interesting topics on materials, 2D-fabrication or IR sources (VSCEL on heterojunctions - 
  they are studied by prof Belkin's group)

<h3> List of labs where I should write to </h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/nanomaterials-as-white-light-emitters-for-low-cost-lighting/?p86964">
  Nanomaterials as White Light Emitters for Low Cost Lighting </a>
  - This is the project for which all steps are determined well (Project aims are structured
  in the bottom of a page. This is just from findaphd.com and applications are accepted all
  tear round. University of Bradford, department of Life Sciences.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/quantum-coherence-and-carrier-dynamics-in-colloidal-nanostructures-from-dots-to-1d-and-2d-materials/?p106541">
  Quantum coherence and carrier dynamics in colloidal nanostructures from dots to 1D and 2D materials
  </a>
  - This is the project with colloidal nanostructure what is already interesting enough for research.
  Host: Cardiff University, School of Physics and Astronomy
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://ldsd.group.shef.ac.uk/research/2d-materials/"> 
  Sub-wavelength all-dielectric nano-photonics: 2D materials and beyond </a>
  - An outstanding lab (according to an advertisment) with 4PhD and 3 postdocs. Very 
  strong team with the head from Russia, Tartakovskii. But the work at some sence is connected
  with investigations of spins states. It is a little bit sad. But it is worth to write there.
  Host: The University of Sheffield
</p>

<p>
  Also there are several supervisors from thos lab like E Chekhovich, D Krizhanovskii
  M Fox (Quantum optics using quantum dots), M S Skolnick. If i am not mistaken, they all
  are from one lab/several collaborating labs. It is possible to find them in the previous link or
  on <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/postgraduate/phd/scholarships/projects> this site </a>
  in the section "semiconductors" in Search
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.cens.de/careers/international-call-for-phd-students-and-postdocs/krenner-phd-2020/">
  Optomechanics with Quantum dots </a>
  A PhD position for investigation of single quantum dots under low temperatures by IR laser
  spectroscopy. Main goal for project is to develop a photonic circuits to enhance or
  suppress the integration between elastic waves and QDs. Project contains complex numerical
  modeling and fabrication process. Required strong knowledge of semiconductors, solid state,
  preferably sc quantum optics, and benefitially clean room skills.
  <a href='http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/exp1/emmynoether/'> Group site </a> 
  with e-mails of lab leader Hubert J. Krenner.

  Group of Direct bandgap alloys </a>
  in Peter Grunberg (you remember that text about Nobel prize winners in English seminar)
  Institute in Julich. Very cool prerequisites - everything suits to me and I suit for everything.
  <p>
  <a href = 'https://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Stellenangebote/_common/dna/2020D-020-EN-PGI-9.html?nn=722008'>
  Official vacancy on Institute's site. </a>
  </p>
  <p>
  I think that it would be better to write Dan Buca, the head of the group. By the way, he
  has quite a lot of fresh and well-cited papers.
  </p>
</p>
<p>
  <a href='https://www.graphenelabs.at/'> Thomas Mueller research group </a>
  They are dealing with 2D materials and Thomas had a performance in Skoltech not so long
  ago. He is a really cool specialist - it is fully proved by his Hirsch at Google Scholar.
  As usual, there are lots of equipment but the main thing is that they have a cleanroom. I
  do not exactly know if they have actual tasks on 2D materials or sth that suits me but
  moreover I should write and find out this uncertainties.
